  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Design

## Prototype

## Build, strengthen and optimize

## Deploy

Deploying with {golem} and shinyapps.io is very straightforward, just run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
golem::add_shinyappsio_file()
```

and then, assuming that {rsconnect} is already configured: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rsconnect::deployApp()
```
